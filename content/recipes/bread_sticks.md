                "Run the strong flour through a sieve and then mix the ingredients from Group A, then add in water and stir. Warm the butter to room temperature.",

                "Knead and mix the dough from Step 1 with our hands and bring it all together in a ball. When you can easily remove it from the bowl, move it to a surface that's been lightly dusted with flour",

                "Push down on it, and then spread it out with your hands, and then fold it back over and push it down and spread it out again. Repeat this. Once it's smooth and easily removed from the surface, fold in the butter and kneed some more.",

                "Once the butter has been thoroughly mixed in and the dough stays together after it's lifted off the surface, lift it up and then smack it into the surface, and then roll it up away from you. Change the direction and repeat. Do this for 20 minutes, until you can stretch the dough with your fingers and it forms a thin film without breaking.",

                "Coat a big bowl with a thin film of vegetable oil (not listed in the ingredients), then put in the dough from Step 4 and cover with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise for one hour by either placing it in a warm place, or a bowl of lukewarm water.",

                "Dust your index finger with flour and then use it to poke a hole in the dough. If the hole remains even after the finger is removed, it's done rising!",

                "Cut the dough from Step 6 into 6 equal parts, then press down on them softly. Then fold the edges you cut inwards, while you pull down the dough from the top down to roll it up. Pinch the point where the top touches the bottom with your fingers to close it, then move the dough to a cooking sheet with the pinched part facing down",

                "Cover the dough with a wet cloth that's been thoroughly wrung out for 15 minutes to let it rest.",

                "Place the dough on a surface, then press down slightly and use a rolling pin to roll it out into a long shape",

                "Put the edge of the dough on a bamboo stick, then pull slightly as you wrap the rest of it around. Pinch the edges to make sure they're stuck on tight.",

                "Cook on a charcoal grill. Once the bread is easily removed from the stick, it's done!"
