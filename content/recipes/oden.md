#steps
1. Soak the hidaka-kombu in water for 1 hour

2. Peel the daikons. Cut into 3cm length sections and lightly score an x with a kitchen knife. Boil the daikon in water until tender and easily pierced with a skewer and then transfer to cold water

3. Score both sides of the konnyaku, then boil in water. After boiling for 5 minutes, drain the konnyau and cut it into your desired shape

4. Take stock from Step 1 and put over medium heat. Just before boiling remove the kombu and add the bonito flakes. Remove from heat and let sit for 2 minutes. Strain broth with cheese cloth. Add soy sauce, mirin, and salt

5. Cut kombu strips into 3-4 equal sized pieces and then tie inot a knot

6. Soft boil the eggs and then remove the shells

7. Add the daikon, konnyaku, and kombu to the stock and return stock to the heat. When boiling drop to low heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes. If the daikon goes soft that's okay! Add the eggs and remove from heat

8. Cut the aburaage into two equal parts. Full pockets of aburaage with sliced mochi. Pin closed with a toothpick

9. Boil fried tofu fritter, fried fishcake, shrimp fritters and then drain

10. Add Step 8 and Step 9 to the broth and return to heat. After boiling add any remaining ingredients. Keep warm on low heat and enjoy!

11. Wrap tofu with a cloth. Weigh down and allow it to sit for at least 1 hour. Lightly squeeze tofu to drain excess water, and then mash with mortar and pestle

12. Shred the Japanese yam and add to the tofu. Add salt and black sesame and mix well

13. Split mixture into 4 parts and add to 170Â°C oil. Lower heat and fry for 4-5 minutes

14. Cut lotus root into 4 equal pieces and add to water

15. Mince the cod and blend with food processor

16. De-vein the shrimp. Dry with paper towel and then mince and blend with food processor

17. Add portion of cod for satsuma-age along with seasoning to mortar and mix well

18. Drain the lotus root. With oiled hands cover the lotus root with the mixture from Step 4
