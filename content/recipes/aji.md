### steps
1. "Mince the ginger and finely dice the green onion",

2. "Cut the ribs way from the fish you've cut into three pieces. Use your fingers to find any pin bones left and remove them with fish bone tweezers. Lift up the skin a little on the head side and then hold the fillet down and rip it off. Cut the fillet into thin slices",

3. "Using quick horizontal strokes so that you don't crush the flesh, chop into smaller pieces. Then add the ingredients from Step 1 and the miso. Use your knife to chop and mix",


4. "Remove the gills from the heads and split each one in two vertically. Carefully wash way the blood cut each backbone into three pieces and wash them. Chop off the tails. Cut the diakon radish into thin rectangles.",

5. "To get rid of the fish smell, pour boiling water over the leftovers from Step 1. Transfer immediately to a bowl of cold water.",

6. "Put the konbu, daikon radish, and leftovers in 1 liter of water and turn on heat. Once it starts to boil, skim the scum from the top. Simmer on low for 10 minutes. Once the daikon radish softens, turn off the heat and stir in the miso. Serve in bowls an garnish with mitsuba."

### points
