#name

#servings
null

#ingredients
- 6 large shrimp (headless/in-shell)
- 1 egg
- Wheat flour, Panko to taste
- Frying oil to taste

- 2 eggs
- 40g scallions
- 1/2tsp salt
- 20g pickles
- 1tbsp cut parsley

- 80g mayonnaise
- 1tsp squeezed lemon juice

#steps
1. Deshell the shrimp, leaving the tails attached. Make ashallow cut down the center of the back to devein. Make a bowl of 3% saltwater and wash the shrimp, then rinse in running water and blot dry with a paper towel

2. Cut off the very ends of the tails then fan with a knife, removing water adn any dirt

3. Make 3-4 cuts on the belly of each shrimp, then straighten them out

4. Batter with the wheat flour, beaten egg, and panko in that order, then fry in oil at 170Â°C for about three minutes

5. Remove with a sieve that can be used in oil. Drain off any remaining oil, letting the residual heat finish the cooking. All done!

6. Boil water. Add salt (beyond that listed in the ingredient). Boil the egg for about 10 minutes

7. Dice the scallions and mix with the salt, then let sit. After a while, put the mixture in a cloth and work it with your hands. When you feel it start to congreal, rinse the entire thing in running water, continuing to work the scallions so as to rinse of the salt. Give it a good squeeze to get all the water out

8. Take the egg from Step 1, the pickles, and the parsley and chop them finely

9. Put everything from Step 2 and Step 3 in a bowl and add Group A. Add a pinch of salt and pepper (not specified in ingredients), and when you get it to taste, you're done!

#points
- If you put in too many shrimp at once, the oil will cool. Don't add more than two-thirds of the amount of oil you have!

- If you move the shrimp with your chopsticks immediately after putting it in the oil, the panko will come loose DOn't fiddle with it too much! Turn it over partway through, raise the temperature at the end, and aim for that nice crunch

- Feel free to add chopped cabbage
