- Rolling pin 2-3cm diameter, 60-90cm long
- Vinyl sheet (can substitute with 10kg rice bag or tick garbage bag)

- 5g bonito flakes

#steps
1. Add the salt to the water. Stir until completely dissolved

2. Sieve the flour

3. Add Step 2 to Step 1 gradually and mix together, making sure all the flour is combined with the water.

4. Clump Step 3 together and cover in plastic wrap. Let sit for 10 minutes

5. Wrap Step 4 in the vinyl sheet. Knead by stepping on it every 4-5 minutes

6. Turn the dough over. Fold the left and right side inwards, folding it into three. Then fold the top and bottom, creating a square shape

7. Lay the dough back down on the vinyl sheet, folded side down. Step on it for 4-5 minutes. Repeat Step 6 and Step 7 again

8. Turn the dough over and fold the square into itself. Transfer the dough to a bowl. Roll the edges to the center, making the dough round

9. Seal the dough in a resealable bag. Let rest for 2-3 hours

10. Dust the top of the dough with flour. Push and stretch the dough while dusting with flour

11. Roll the dough with a rolling pin into 1cm thick circle. Continue to dust with an appropriate amount of flour for the following steps

12. Roll out the dough moving from the center to the edge

13. Roll out the dough in the same way on opposite corner, creating a diamond shape

14. Turn the dough 90 degrees and roll out one corner in the same way. Then turn the dough around and do the same to the final corner until the dough is a square

15. Wind the dough around the rolling pin from one corner

16. Roll the dough wrapped rolling pin while pushing down. Repeat this 7-8 times

17. Un-roll the dough

18. Follow Step 15 to Step 17 with the other three corners

19. Move the edge of the dough towards you and repeat Step 15 to Step 18. Roll out to a thickness of 3-4mm

20. Make sure the dough is an even thickness

21. Dust the dough with flour and wrap the dough around the rolling pin

22. Fold the dough back in on itself in a mountain on a chopping board

23. Dust with flour and cut into 3-5mm thick strips

24. Gather them in a bundle (about 15 strips) and strike them again the chopping board

25. Combine the soy sauce and mirin on the stove. Once it simmers lower the heat and add the bonito flakes

26. Simmer for 1 minute then turn off the heat. Let rest

27. Once the stock has cooled run the stock through a sieve. Squeeze the clumps through the sieve

- Dust with flour so the cut noodles don't stick together
