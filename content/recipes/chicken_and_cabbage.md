                [
                    "800g cabbage (1/4 of 1 large head)",
                    "300g chicken thighs",
                    "50cc sake"
                ],

                [
                    "6g grated garlic",
                    "2tbsp (30cc) soy sauce"
                ]
            ],

### "steps": [
                "Cut the cabbage into 3-4cm chunks. Separate the leaves from teh core. Cut the thicker parts in half. Remove moisture",

                "Slice the chicken into 12 equal pieces",

                "Lay the chicken skin side down in a pan and pour sake over the top. Add the cabbage core pieces, cover with a lid and cook",

                "Cook over a high heat for 5 minutes. Stir once then add the remaining leaves",

                "Cook for another five minutes and you're done! Cover in Group A and enjoy!"
            ],

### "points": [
                "During **Step 4** the chicken should turn white",

                "Only using a little sauce exemplifies the umami. When simmering make sure it doesn't burn and lose all its moisture over the high heat!"
