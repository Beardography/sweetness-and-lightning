#ingredients
- 40g carrot (you'll use 3-4cm of the thickest part of the carrot)
- 160g burdock root
- 1/2tbsp sesae oil
- Some roasted sesame seeds (white)

- 4tsp soy sauce
- 3 tbsp each of mirin, sake
    
#steps
1. Peel the carrot and slice off about 1cm from each side to make square edges...Slice thinly into pieces about the same size as you will cut the burdock root.

2. Wash the dirt off the burdock root and scrub lightly with a scrub brush.

3. Put the sesame oil into the frying pan and fry the burdock root from Step 2. Fry on medium heat for 3-4 minutes, and then add the carrot from Step 1. Fry for an additional minute and then add the ingredients from Group A.

4. Boil it down for 4-5 minutes until the liquid is gone, then add roasted sesame seeds and you're done


#points
- A lot of the flavor of the burdock root is in its skin, so don't scrub htat part off.

- Don't soak it in water because you'll lose the scent and flavor. Be ready to fry as soon as you cut it!
