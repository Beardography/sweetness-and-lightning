#ingredients
- 200-250g shelled oysters
- 2-3 slices ginger (thin sliced)

- 75cc soy sauce
- 125cc mirin
- 200cc sake

- 500g beef tendon
- 1 piece konnyaku (Devil's Tongue) jelly
- 500g daikon radish

- 1 stalk green onion (green part only)
- 2-3 pieces ginger (thinly sliced)

- 50g Hatcho miso
- 40g awase miso
- 200cc mirin
- 1.5tbsp each sugar and soy sauce

- Diced onions
- Shichimi spice to taste

#steps
1. Fill a bowl with 3% salt water and wash the oysters. Put in boiling water, then drain immediately. Once cooled, arrange on a tray by size

2. Put Group A in a pot and heat until reduced by about half, then add ginger

3. Put about half the oysters in the pot, starting with the biggest ones, and cook on medium heat for about 3 minutes. When thoroughly heated, drain over a bowl to catch the water from the pot

4. Cook the remaining oysters as in Step 3

5. Return the water you drained off to the pot and continue to cook it. When it gets to be less than about 150cc, turn off the heat and allow to cool

6. Put the cooked oysters in something you can close securely, pour the liquid from Step 5 over them, and refrigerate

7. Fill a pot with water and put in the beef tendon. Heat over high heat until boiling, then skim the broth and boil for five minutes

8. Discard the liquid from Step 1, then wash the beef tendon thoroughly and cut into bite-sized pieces

9. Put 1L of water into a pot, add the beef and Group A, and heat. When it boils, skim the broth, then cover and simmer for 90 minutes on low flame.

10. Use a spoon to break the konnyaku into pieces (as big or small as you like), then boil for five minutes and drain. Chop the daikon radish into 7-8mm slices

11. Remove the green onion from what you made in Step 3, then add what you made in Step 4, cover again, and continue to simmer on low flame for another 30 minutes

12. Add the entirety of Group B to the pot, remove the lid, and stew for 30 minutes to an hour on low heat. When the liquid is mostly gone and the whole thing has a springiness to it, it's ready to eat! Arrange on a plate and garnish with Group C

#points
- If the oysters get too hot, they'll toughen and become unpleasant to eat, so don't cook the small ones for quite as long

- Make sure to skim it occasionally while simmering
