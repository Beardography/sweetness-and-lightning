#ingredients
- 200g thinly-sliced beef
- 1 large onion
- 3tbsp soy sauce
- 1.5tbsp sugar
- 5x5cm block of kombu
- 400g potatoes (May Queen)
- 150g Shirataki
- 3tbsp mirin
- 200cc water
- 1.5tbsp of sesame oil

#steps
1. Cut the Shirataki into bite-sized lengths, then simmer for 3 minutes before straining

2. Peel the potatoes, then cut into 6-8 evenly-sized chunks and rinse. Halve the onion, then chop coarsely. Cut the beef into bite-sized pieces. Cover the kombu with the water

3. Heat the sesame oil in a pan. Add the rinsed potato and cook over medium heat. When the edges of the potato begin to turn translucent, add the onion

4. After cooking the onion and potatoes together for a short time, add the kombu and water

5. When Step 4 comes to a boil, add sugar and mirin. Cover and boil for about 3 minutes

6. Add soy sauce to Step 5, then add beef, arranging beef slices evenly so they don't overlap

7. Skim off any foam, then add the shirataki. Cover again. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, then you're done!

8. Once cooked, let cool for flavors to marry. Keep stirring occasionally!
