#ingredients
- 2 cups rice

- 20g walnuts
- 1 tbsp white sesame seeds

- 1 tbsp miso
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp mirin
- 1 tbsp sugar

            
#steps
1. Grind Group A in a mortar until you can't see the seeds anymore. Add Group B and mix well.

2. Make firm rice and grind in mortar. Taking enough to make one goheimochi stick, flatten and mold with your hands, then skewer with a disposable chopstick

3. Place over direct heat for 2 minutes on each side, grilling enough to slightly char it.

4. Spread the mixture from Step 1 on both sides and then cook for 2 minutes over direct heat. Once it's slightly charred, it's done.

#points
- Stick the wider end of the chopsticks in. Wrap aluminum foil around the pointed end of chopstick so it doesn't burn while grilling.

- It burns easily, so move it around and keep it a good distance away from the flame.
