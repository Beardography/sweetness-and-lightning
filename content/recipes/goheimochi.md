# Goheimochi
#### servings: null
### ingredients
- "2 cups rice"

- "20g walnuts",
- "1 tbsp white sesame seeds"

- "1 tbsp miso",
- "1 tbsp soy sauce",
- "1 tbsp mirin",
- "1 tbsp sugar"

            
### steps
1. "Grind Group A in a mortar until you can't see the seeds anymore. Add Group B and mix well.",

2. "Make firm rice and grind in mortar. Taking enough to make one goheimochi stick, flatten and mold with your hands, then skewer with a disposable chopstick",

3. "Place over direct heat for 2 minutes on each side, grilling enough to slightly char it.",

4. "Spread the mixture from Step 1 on both sides and then cook for 2 minutes over direct heat. Once it's slightly charred, it's done."


### points
- "Stick the wider end of the chopsticks in. Wrap aluminum foil around the pointed end of chopstick so it doesn't burn while grilling.",

- "It burns easily, so move it around and keep it a good distance away from the flame."
