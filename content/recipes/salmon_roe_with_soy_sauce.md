# Salmon roe with soy sauce / zuke-don (marinated tuna on rice)
#### servings: null
### ingredients
- "200g raw salmon roe",
- "30cc sake",
- "40cc soy sauce",
- "30cc mirin"

- "Sashimi: such as maguro (raw tuna), buri (japanese amberjack), tai (sea bream), ika (squid), salmon, etc",
- "Salmon roe",
- "Soy sauce",
- "sake",
- "mirin"

### steps
1. "Heat a pot of water in a pan. Turn off the heat when it reaches 50Â°C and put the salmon roe in",

2. "Open the skins with chopsticks and a spoon, exposing the bead of the row. Remove what you can and transfer the rest to a colander. Rinse them under cold water",

3. "Remove the large skins. The smaller skins will run off with the water. Repeat the washing process until all skins have been removed",

4. "Remove from colander and transfer roe to a plate that has been lined with kitchen paper towels. Put in the fridge for 30 minutes to remove any excess moisture",

5. "Boil the mirin and sake in a pan. Reduce the heat when it starts boiling. Leave for 1 minute to remove the alcohol",

6. "Once Step 4 has cooled, add the 40cc of soy sauce",

7. "Combine Step 4 and Step 6. Leave for 1 hour and you're done",

8. "Heat up the sake and mirin of the same ratio",

9. "Let 1 cool and add twice the amount of soy sauce",

10. "Lay the sashimi out on a tray and cover with Step 2. You don't need to fill the tray. Shake the tray, making sure everything is covered in sauce",

11. "Let sit in the fridge for 10 minutes",

12. "Fill a donburi bowl with rice and lay nori over the rice. Lay the marinated sashimi over and garnish with salmon roe"

### points
- "It's easier to sometimes to pick remaining skins out of the colander. The ksins will leave a pungent smell, so make sure you remove them all!"
