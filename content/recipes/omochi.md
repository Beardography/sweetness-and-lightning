### ingredients
- 100g azuki beans
- 100g sugar
- pinch of salt
- 3 pieces of square mochi
  
- 200g ground pork
- 1/2 bundle of enoki mushrooms
- 10cm green onion
- 3 pieces of square mochi
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil

- 2 tablespoons mirin
- 2.5 tablespoons (45g) miso

- 1/2 teaspoon miso

### steps
1. Wash the azuki beans and put them in a pot with a lot of water. Boil on high heat. When the water boils, remove the pot from the stove and strain the beans.

2. As in Step 1, return the beans to the pot with fresh cold water, bring the pot to a boil again, then strain. Repeat once more.

3. Return the beans to the pot once more with fresh cold water, and then put the pot on to boil. Once it boils, turn to low heat, and simmer while frequently skimming off the top. If the beans start to emerge from the water, add more water to cover. When it looks like you could crush a bean with your fingers, add the sugar. Boil down to your preferred consistency, and then add the salt.

4. Bake the square mochi and put it in a bowl, then combine with the beans prepared in Step 3, and you're done.

5. Cut enoki mushrooms into 1cm slices, and thinly slice the onions

6. Heat a frying pan, add the sesame oil, and sate the pork. Once the pork is browned, add in the ingredients from Step 1.

7. Once the mushrooms start to soften, add the ingredients from Group A, and simmer until the sauce caramelizes. Pair with boiled square mochi.

8. Put the mirin in a small pot, and simmer to burn off the alcohol. Add the sugar, and once it dissolves into the mirin, allow to cool.

9. Crush the walnuts with a mortar and pestle. Add the miso and the ingredients from Step 1, then mix again. Add sauce on top of boiled square mochi, and you're done.
