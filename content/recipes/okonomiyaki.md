#points
- Add whatever ingredients you want, like tempura flakes, pickled ginger, konnyaku, shiitake mushrooms, or cheese!

- Mix the filling for each okonomiyaki just befoer you fry it. If oyu mix several at once, by the time you're done cooking, the moisture will be gone and it might not be good.
