# Yeast Doughnuts
#### servings: null
### ingredients
- 100 g each of weak flour and strong flour
- 4g dry yeast
- 30g superfine sugar
- 2g salt

- 1 egg
- 70cc milk

- 20g butter (room temperature)
- pinch of flour (for kneading)
- Some vegetable oil

### steps
1. Put Group A into a bowl and mix

2. Heat Group B by placing first bowl in a larger bowl filled with hot water. Warm until it's the temperature of your skin

3. Add Step 2 to Step 1, and mix until a dough forms. Dust a surface with flour and place the dough on top. Mix the butter while stretching and folding the dough, kneading for eight minutes.

4. Place the dough into a bowl greased with vegetable oil and cover with plastic wrap. Then place that bowl in a bowl filled with water the temperature for a hot bath for an hour to allow dough to rise.

5. Press down on the dough to expell any gas, and divide into eight portions. Mold into little balls, cover with a damp cloth, and let them sit for about 15 minutes.

6. Flatten each ball and make a hole with your finger. Turn the rings while widening the hole. Place doughnuts on a plate covered with parchment paper nd leave in a warm spot for one hour to allow the dough to rise. If when you press the dough with a finger, it slowly returns to it's original shape, the second rise is done.

7. Fry each side for a minute and a half in oil heated to 170-180Â°C

### points
- Spread the doughwith your fingers. If it stretches out thin without tearing, it's ready!

- Poke a hole in the dough with a finger. If the hole stays there after you take your finger out, the first rise is done!

- You can do whatever you want with the doughnuts, including coating them iwth a glaze of powdered sugar and water, or dipping them in chocolate melted in a double boiler!
