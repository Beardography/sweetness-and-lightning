3. Put the pork from Step 2 in a pot

4. Add Group A and heat. When it begins to stew, reduce to low flame and cover with a parchment paper lid. After about 10 minutes, add about half the soy sauce, adding the rest after another 10 minutes

5. Let cook for another 20 minutes, then turn off the heat and let cool. When cool, but in refrigerator overnight

6. Remove the pargment paper lid, then remove the pork, which should be solid on the surface

7. Put the pot over low heat, and add mirin when boiling. Let simmer for about fifteen minutes, and you're done!

#points
