                "Soak the cloud ear mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes. Shred the mushrooms and the pork",

                "Cut holes the chinese noodle packages and heat them in the microwave. Once they're warm, place the noodles in a bowl and toss thoroughly",

                "Heat a small amount of cooking oil in a frying pan, then spread noodles evenly in pan. Without stirring, fry over medium ehat",

                "Toss the pan occasionally to cook noodles evenly. When they begin to brown, turn noodles such that both sides are cooked",

                "Set aswide cooked noodles. Heat a small amount of sesame oil in the frying pan and stir-fry pork over medium heat",

                "Once the pork is cooked, add the onions. Once the onions soften, add the mushrooms, then the sprouts, and stir-fry",

                "Add the noodles while the sprouts are still crisp. Add the mixture from Group A and stir to combine",

                "Soak the dried shrimp in warm water for 30 minutes, then remove. (the directions are the same as in the oyster sauce yakisoba. Mix the water from the shrimp with A, and add the shrimp in at Step 6 along with the pork!)"
