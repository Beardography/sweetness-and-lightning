### points
- The eggs come out better fi you make it for one person at a time, but you can make up to two portions at once and it'll turn out fine. If you want to make it for 4 people, follow all the steps up to number 3 as above, then after waiting the 5 minutes, split the mixture into two and follow **Step 5** - **Step 7** for each separate half.

- Give the eggs a bit of a mix before putting them into the frypan. You want the whites and the yolks stll a bit separated. When you put them in the pan, pour the eggs in spiral, starting from the center and working your way towards the outside.
