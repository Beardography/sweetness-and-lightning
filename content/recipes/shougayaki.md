#ingredients
- 1 onion
- 3 cabbage leaves
- 9-12 slices of pork loin (thick)
- Some vegetable oil and flour
- Side vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, boiled broccoli, etc)

- 2 tbsp each of soy sauce, sake, and mirin
- 10g grated ginger

- pinch of grated ginger
            
#steps
1. Chop the onion into thin slices. Mix Group A thoroughly

2. Shred the cabbage and soak in ice water for several minutes to make it crisp. Drain.

3. Heat vegetable oil in the frying pan and fry up the onion from Step 1. Once it softens up, add Group B. Remove the onion when the excess moisture has evaporated.

4. Cut away extra connective tissue from the pork, then dredge with flour and pat. Fry 3-4 pieces of pork at a time, both sides, and then remove when browned.

5. Pour half of the thoroughly mixed Group A into the frying pan from Step 4, and bring to a boil. Put half of the pork back in and cover with the sauce. Once it's done, take it out and repeat with the other half.

6. Put the cabbage from Step 2 onto a plate, arrange the onions from Step 3 in front, and place the pork on top. Add the side vegetables.

#points
- Lets try shredding! Remove the core. Fold leaves over and roll up. Press down lightly and start shredding from the side while you remove the core
