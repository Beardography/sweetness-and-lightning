1. Cut Group A ingredients into 5mm cubes. Dissolved boullion cube in a 300cc of boiling water to make broth. Mince Group B ingredients.

2. Heat the vegetable oil in a pot, then fry the garlic and ginger. Once it starts to smell good, add the onions and fry them. When they turn clear, add the carrot, celery, and eggplant in that order and continue to cook.

3. Add the ground pork to the pot, and once it's browned, add the curry powder and salt.

4. Add the diced tomatoes, and once the mixture starts to boil, add the grated apple, then the raisins, green bell pepper, and the broth from Step 1. Cook over medium-high heat and just over 10 minutes to boil the curry down.
