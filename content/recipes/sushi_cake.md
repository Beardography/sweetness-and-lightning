#ingredients
- 120g fresh cod (a little less than two fillets)
- 2-3 tbsp sake

- 2 tsp mirin
- 2 tsp light soy sauce
- 1 piece salted salmon
- 2 eggs
- salt
- vegetable oil
- 2 packs maitake mushroom

- 3 tbsp mirin
- 1.5 tbsp soy sauce
- 300g rice
- 1 square (5cm) of kombu

- 40cc sushi vinegar
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1.4 teaspoons salt
- carrots
- string beans
- salmon roe
        
#steps
1. Put the fresh cod in a small pot and stir in sake. Put a lid on the pot and cook on low heat. Once it starts to bubble, continue to simmer for 3 minutes. Remove bones, skin, and dark meat, and then grind in a mortar

2. Add fish from Step 1 to a frying pan and sate on low heat. Once the moisture has evaporated and the fish has softened, add the ingredients from Group A. Continue cooking until the meat crumbles and plumps up.

3. Cook the salted salmon until it's soft

4. Beat the egg in a bowl and add salt. Add oil on the frying pan and coat the bottom of the pan with a very thin layer of the egg mixture, and cook until set. Remove egg and repeat 3 more times, for four thin egg crepes total. Cut these in half and stack them, then julienne.

5. Tear the maitake mushrooms into fine chunks. Put them in the pot along with Group B, cover with an otoshibuta lid and turn to medium heat. After 5 minutes, remove lid, and continue to simmer.

6. Parboil the carrots and string beans with salt, transfer to cold water and cut into your desired shapes.

7. Rinse the rice and add the kombu, then cook with slightly less water than usual. Mix the ingredients in Group C thoroughly, and then add them to the rice. Mix well and cut into four parts.

8. Take a deep container (Tupperware or a cake mold) and lay the eggs from Step 4 along the bottom.

9. Put 1/4 of the rice from Step 7 in a thin layer over the egg. Use a flat-bottomed glass or a spoon, coated with the remaining vinegar mixture, to push down on the rice and spread it out evenly into the corners.

10. Repeat this process with cod → rice → salmon → rice → mitake → rice.

11. Invert the bowl to gently remove the 'cake,' and decorate with the roe and the ingredients in Step 6.
            
#points
- The meat will stick to the pan, so when it does, remove from heat and scrape it off. Make sure it doesn't burn.

- Leave a little bit of vinegar mixture from **Group C**.
