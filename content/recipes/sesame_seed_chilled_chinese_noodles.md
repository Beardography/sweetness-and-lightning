#### servings: null
### ingredients
- "3 packs of fresh Chinese noodles",
- "1 chicken thigh (slightly less than 300g)",
- "1/3 carrot",
- "150g cabbage (without the core)",
- "1 cucumber",
- "Eggs (as many as you like)",
- "25g salted wakame (parboiled)",
- "1 tomato"

- "6tsp salt",
- "1 tbsp sake",
- "1 Japanese leek (the green part)",
- "4 pieces thinly sliced ginger"

- "2tbsp sugar",
- "2 1/2 tbsp vinegar",
- "5 tbsp soy sauce",
- "3 tbsp white sesame paste",
- "1 tbsp ground sesame seeds",
- "2 tsp sesame oil",
- "(Roughly) 3 tbsp leftover chicken broth"

### steps
1. "Sprinkle the chicken thigh with the sake and salt seasoning and let it sit for at least 20 minutes. Slice the green part of the Japanese leek on the diagonal. Get your steamer ready.",

2. "Arrange half of the onions from Step 1 plus 2 thin slices of ginger on a deep plate. Place the chicken skin side up on top, and then scatter the rest of the onion and ginger over that. Once the water in the steamer starts to boil, put the rack on the upper level, put the lid on, and steam on high heat for 20 minutes",

3. "Julienne the carrot into thick matchsticks, then boil (starting from col water). Once tender, transfer them to a bowl of cold water to soak. Tear the cabbage into pieces. Put them in a metal colander and steam over the pot of boiling water for 4 minutes. Once done, spread the cabbage out on a tray and let it cool.",

4. "Julienne the cucumber. Hard-boil and peel the eggs. Rehydrate the seaweed and rinse carefully. Cut the eggs and seaweed into easy-to-eat pieces. Cut the tomato into thin slices.",

5. "Once the ingredients and Step 2 are done steaming, take out the bowl. Measure out the juice to use the sesame sauce, and then let the chicken keep cooking in the remaining heat. Once 10 minutes have passed, put the chicken into a plastic bag and chill it in ice water.",

6. "Mix all ingredients for the sesame see sauce together. Once the ingredients from Step 5 and cold, take out the chicken thigh and cut into bite-sized pieces.",

7. "Boil the noodles. Arrange the noodles and other ingredients on a plate, and cover in sesame seed sauce."


### points
- "It's a good idea to cover the underside of the lid with a cloth and let the steamer so that water doesn't drip out."
