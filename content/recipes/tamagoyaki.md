#ingredients
- 3 eggs
- 50cc dashi
- 1 1/2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp light soy sauce
- Pinch of salt
- Some vegetable oil
    
#steps
1. Dissolve the sugar in the dashi while the latter is still warm. Add the soy sauce and salt

2. Crack the eggs into a bowl and stir gently with cooking chopsticks without letting them foam. Add the ingredients from Step 1 and stir again.

3. Heat the tamagoyaki pan on medium heat. Dip a folded paper towel in the vegetable oil and use this to mop the pan. Pour 1/4 of the egg mixture from Step 2 into the pan and allow it to spread out

4. Cook while poking the parts that bulge up with your cooking chopsticks. Once the surface of the egg sheet is no longer runny, roll it up from the rear to the front before it sets completely, using the chopsticks. Once you're done, move the egg to the back.

5. Wipe the open pan surface with the oiled paper towel. Pour the same amount of egg mixture as before into the pan and allow it to spread. Lift up the already-wrapped egg at the back and allow the liquid to spread under it, as well.

6. Repeat Steps 4 and Step 5 four times total.  When you're done, place the egg mass on a makisu and shape it.

7. Leave it alone for a while to let it solidify, then take it out of the makisu and slice as preferred. It's done!

#points
- If you add the sugar all at once, it's easy to burn, so it's okay to start with just a little.

- Beat in a straight line back and forth without lifting the tips of the chopsticks from the bottom of the bowl. When you're done, hte egg white should still be visible. Take care not to mix too much

- The eggs will turn out fluffier if cooked over high heat. Control the temperature by moving the tamagoyaki pan up and down. If it looks like it's about to burn, take it away from the fire, okay?
