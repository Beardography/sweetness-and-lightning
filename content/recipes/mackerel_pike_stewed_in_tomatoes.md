- some flour
- 1 tbsp olive oil

#steps
1. Fillet the pike. Remove the ara (the head and bones), and cut the meat into three equal pieces. Mince the onions.

2. Put the head and bones into a small pot. Put in enough water to thoroughly cover them and cook on high until they boil.

3. Cook on low heat for 15 minutes, continually skimming off the scum. Strain in a strainer and save about a cup of soup

4. Lightly salt (salt not listed in ingredients) the pike and add flour. Put down olive oil in the frying pan and fry on medium heat, skin facing up

5. Once it gets a nice color, flip it and fry the skin side, then remove.

6. Put the onions from Step 1 into the frying pan from Step 5 and fry them. Once they're browned add the canned tomatoes, the soup from Step 3, and the ingredients in Group A. Once it starts to boil turn to low heat and put a lid on it.

7. Let cook for 20 minutes before adding the shimeji mushrooms and boil for 5 more minutes. Add in the pike you removed from Step 5.

8. Once it's nice and warm, add salt to taste and it's done!

9. Fillet the pike, and cut the meat into two equal pieces. Dust with flour.

10. Put vegetable oil in the frying pan and heat, then cook the pike skin side down first.

11. Once both sides have grill marks on them, add in Group A.

12. Once it's started to boil for a bit, it's done!

#points
- Remove the gills on the head and split it into two pieces. Cut the backbone around the center. Wash both thoroughlyto remove the blood. Use the rib bones that you scraped off, too.
