- 3 tbsp soy sauce / some yellow yuzu"

- 1tsp mirin"

- 1 tbsp yellow yuzu citrus juice",
- 1 tbsp soy sauce"


#steps
1. Chop the daikon radish in 2.5-3cm slices and cut into quarters. Boil for 15 minutes, then place in cold water.

2. Chop up the buri ara, place in a bowl, and add hot water. Once the surface of the fish turns white, place in cold water, and remove the scales and the dark meat.

3. Put the buri ara and daikon radish in the pot, add Group A, then turn to medium-high heat and cover with the otoshibuta lid. Five minutes after it starts to boil, add in Group B. Boil for five more minutes then add in the soy sauce.

4. Simmer for five more minutes, then turn off the heat and let it sit for 20 minutes to allow the flavor to seep through.

5. Put on a plate and garnish with julienned yellow uzu skin, and it's done!

6. Slice the carrots and cucumbers into 7-8mm cubes. Cut the kaibashira in half. Break apart the shimeji. Add water to the seaweed to plump it up, then cut into bite-sized chunks.

7. Parboil the carrots and shimeji, then strain and allow to cool. Boil the mirin to remove the alcohol.

8. Mix the mirin from Step 2 with the ingredients from Group A, then pour over the other ingredients, allow to marinate, and you're done


#points
- If they're slightly hard when you poke them with a toothpick, they're okay!

- Stir the liquid occasionally to make it easier for the flavor to blend
