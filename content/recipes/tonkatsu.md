                "Take pork out of fridge and let it get close to room temperature.",

                "Using the tip of the knife, cut 5 or 6 places in the fiber that forms the boundary between the meat and fat",

                "Using hte base of the knife, lightly pound the meat. Salt and pepper both sides, and if the meat stretches, nudge it toward the former size",

                "Prepare flour, beaten egg, and breadcrumbs",

                "Cover the pork on both sides with flour, patting it in",

                "Dip the pork in the beaten egg mixture, and then flip so that it gets totally covered",

                "Coat a surface in the breadcrumbs, and place the pork on top of it. Then put breadcrumbs on top, push in with your hands, flip, and repeat several times. Then coat the sides with breadcrumbs as well, and let sit for a while",

                "Pour about 3cm of oil in a frying pan, and when the temperature reaches 170C put both pork loins in",

                "Don't touch until breading hardens. When 3 minutes have passed, flip and fry for 3 more minutes",

                "Place the meat on it's side on a cooking rack so that the excess oil drains off",

                "Let sit for two minutes to allow it to finish cooking then cut into bite-sized slices",

                "Combine mixture in small saucepan, and put on low heat",
