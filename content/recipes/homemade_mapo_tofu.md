#ingredients
- 1 (350g) block silken tofu
- 100g ground pork
- 3-4 (15g) green onions
- 1 dried shiitake mushroom
- 2tsp potato starch
- some garlic

- 10g Haccho miso
- 10g miso you use usually use
- 1/2tbsp sugar
- 2tsp soy sauce
- 1tbsp mirin

#steps
1. Put the dried shiitake in 200cc water and let erhydrate for 3 hours (conserve liquid)

2. Cut tofu into 2cm cubes, and onions into preferred size. Mince garlic and slice shiitaek into thin strips

3. Mix the Group A ingredients, blending miso well

4. Put 1L of water and a half tablespoon of salt into a pot, stir on medium heat, and boil the tofu. Once it comes to a boil, strain tofu to remove excess water

5. Put a small amount of cooking oil down in a frying pan, then spread out the pork in the pan and cook on medium. Don't mess with hte meat when it's in the pan too much just flip it when it turns color on top

6. Once the pork is browned, break it up with a spatula and add the minced garlic

7. Once you can smell the garlic, turn to low heat and add Group A ingredients and the shiitake, breaking up the meat further as you stir it in

8. Once the A ingreidents are thoroughly mixed with the meat, and the fat starts to appear in the pan, ad 150cc of the liquid you used to hydrate the shiitake. Once it's mixed in, add in the tofu

9. Turn to medium heat and let it come to a boil for 1-2 minutes. Add onions as well as the potato starch (mix it with water first!)

10. Mix and heat until it thickens, and you're done!

#points
- Mix the potato starch with an equal volume of water. Put it in several small dashes, mixing immediately when you put it in.
