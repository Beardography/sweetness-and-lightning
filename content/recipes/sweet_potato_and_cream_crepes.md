#### servings: null
### ingredients
- 250cc milk
- 20g butter
- 80g weak flour
- 20g granulated sugar
- 100g eggs

- 220g sweet potatoes (peeled)
- 30g granulated sugar
- 100cc milk

- Some crushed almonds

- 300cc cream
- 30g granulated sugar
        
### steps
1. Make the batter. Bring the milk to room temperature. Put the butter in a frying pan on medium heat. Once the bubbles in the butter disappear and it turns a light brown, take it off the heat and cool on top of a wet cloth.

2. Sif the weak flour into a bowl, add the granulated sugar, and stir well. Make a little depression in the center, add the egg, and mix. Add in the butter from Step 1 and mix thoroughly.

3. Add the milk from Step 1 little by little into the ingredients from Step 2, stirring as you go. Let the batter sit in a cool place for around an hour.

4. Make the sweet potato cream. Cut the sweet potatoes into 2-3cm slices, and place them in water to get rid of any bitterness. When about 10 minutes have passed, take them out and put them in a bowl with 1tbsp of water. Wrap and microwave for 5 minutes.

5. Mash the ingredients in Step 4 with a masher and mix in the granulated sugar. Boil the milk and stir in little by little

6. Place the ingredients from Group A into a bowl, then place that bowl into a larger bowl which you have filled with ice water. Whip the cream until it's at the point where it forms stiff peaks.

7. Heat the frying pan from Step 2 on medium heat and wipe away excess butter with a paper towel

8. Ladle approximately 40ccs of the batter into the center of the pan. Spread it out in a circle by tilting the pan. Move the frying pan so that all parts are heated evenly.

9. Once the edges of the crepes start turning brown, take the pan off the heat. Pinch the edges of the crepe, and flip it from back to front. Put the pan back on the fire and in 25 seconds, it'll be done!

10. Repeat Step 8 and Step 9 to cook the batter. Put about 30g each (approximately 1/10th of the total) of sweet potato cream and whipped cream on every crepe. Add some crushed almonds, wrap it up, and you're done!
