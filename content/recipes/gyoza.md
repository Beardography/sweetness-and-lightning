### steps
1. Put the strong and weak flour into a bowl and slowly add the water (mixed with the salt) while stirring thoroughly with chopsticks. Once it starts to clump, mix it with your hands and roll it up into a ball. Dust a surface with flour and press out the dough, then fold it over. Do this about 100 times and then put it in a plastic bag for 30 minutes.

2. Mince Group A and mix each ingredient with 1/3 tsp salt, then let sit. Squeeze with a cloth and then strain. Mince Group B, too.

3. Put the pork in a bowl and add Group C. Stir thoroughly. Combine with Step 2 and add the sesame seed oil. Once it's all mixed together, let it sit in the fridge for a while.

4. Take the dough from Step 1 and split it into two parts, then roll each into a log. Cut each log into 12 parts and then dust the cut surfaces with flour. Take a slice and flatten it out with your hand, then roll it out with a rolling pin into a 7-8cm diameter circle.

5. Put the filling on the skin and dab water around the edges. Make little ridges as you close up the skin.

6. Heat oil in a pan and then turn off the heat. Put the gyoza in the pan. Turn on the heat for about 10 seconds, add 100cc of water and put a lid on. Cook on medium heat, and once the water has evaporated, add a small amount of oil and cook until they blown up.

7. Boil a full pot of water, and add the gyoza one by one. Boil for 5-6 minutes and take out once the edges turn clear.
