null

#ingredients
- 1/2 slice of bread (from a six-slice loaf) cut into 1cm cubes
- Crusts on 20-130cc milk

- 1/4 onion (or 1/2 if small)
- 30g bacon
- Dash of salt
- Some ground black pepper

- 1/2 tsp sugar
- Black soybeans
- Roasted soy flour
- Maple syrup (to taste)

#steps
1. Cut onion into thick slices, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and microwave for 2 minutes

2. Cut bacon into 1cm wide pieces, cut in a pot without adding any oil. Once the color's changed and hte bacon fat starts to run, add onions from Step 1.

3. Add the milk, and then the salt and bread once the mixture's about to boil. Simmer at low heat for 2-3 minutes. Once the excess moisture has evaporated and the pudding starts sticking to the pot, transfer to a plate. Add ground pepper, and it's done.

4. Put the milk in a small pot, add sugar, and cook over low heat. Just as it's about to boil, add the bread and simmer for 2-3 minutes, stirring so it doesn't burn

5. Once the excess moisture has evaporated and the pudding starts sticking to the pot, transfer to a plate

6. Add black soybeans, roasted soybean flour, and maple syrup to taste, and it's done
