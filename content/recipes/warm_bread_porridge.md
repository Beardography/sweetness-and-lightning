### steps
1. Cut onion into thick slices, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and microwave for 2 minutes

3. Add the milk, and then the salt and bread once the mixture's about to boil. Simmer at low heat for 2-3 minutes. Once the excess moisture has evaporated and the pudding starts sticking to the pot, transfer to a plate. Add ground pepper, and it's done.
