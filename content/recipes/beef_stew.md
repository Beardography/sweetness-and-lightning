# Beef Stew
#### servings: null,
### ingredients:
- 1 1/2 onions
- 1 carrot
- 1 clove garlic
- 500g beef flank (steak)
- Some salt and pepper
- 200cc red wine
- 6 mushrooms

- 10g butter
- 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil

- 200cc water
- 150g canned tomatoes
- 1 can demi-glace sauce
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Bouquet garnish (one piece each of celery and parsley, and one bay leaf tied with a string)

- 10g butter
- 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil

### steps
- Mince 1/2 of an onion and 1/4 of the carrot. Thinly slice the garlic. Cut the beef into 8 or 9 even portions and season with salt and pepper.

- Heat Group A ingredients in a frying pan and add the beef from Step 1. Sear the meat on high heat. Once all sides are browned, take it out and transfer to a pressure coker

- Use the oil remaining in the frying pan from Step 2 to fry the onion, carrot, and garlic from Step 1. Once the onion is caramelized, add the red wine. Scrape any burnt parts off the pan and add them and the soup to the pressure cooker mentioned in Step 2.

- Turn on the pressure cooker and, once the soup comes to a boil, turn to low heat and simmer 3-4 minutes. Add the ingredients from Group B and cover with the lid.

- Once you start to clearly hear noises from the pressure cooker, turn to medium heat and pressure cook for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it sit for 15 minutes. Once that time is up, release the pressure and open the lid

- Cut the whole onion into wedges and chop up the remaining carrot into chunks. Wipe any dirt off the mushrooms and remove the stems.

- Heat Group C ingredients in a frying pan. Add the ingredients from Step 6 (first carrots, then onions) and slowly fry on low heat. Finally, add the mushrooms, and fry them as well.

- Add ingredients from Step 7 to the pressure cooker from Step 5 and boil for 20-30 minutes. Season to taste and...done!

### points
- Once the stew thickens up, the bottom of the pressure cooker has a tendency to burn, so stir with a spatula once in a while. Also, note that the meat will fall apart easily!
