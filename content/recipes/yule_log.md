                "Mix in milk to the ingredients from Step 4, then add weak flour fun through a sieve. Mix with a rubber spatula, taking care not to crush any air bubbles that form.",

                "Remove the dough from baking sheet. Cover the side that's browned with the ingredients from Step 8, then spread out the Step 7 ingredients on top of it. Roll up the dough, and let it sit for a while to set.",

                "Put the ingredients from Group C into a bowl, then put that bowl in ice water and beat until peaks form.",
