#steps
1. Peel apple and chop finely. Put the apple in the Group A ingredients into a pot, and cook for 30 minutes on low with the lid on

2. Cut off four corners of the baking sheet and fold into an open box shape, then place it into a baking sheet as in the picture above. Warm the oven

3. Beat eggs in a bowl, then add sugar and put it on a double boiler at 60°C , and mix. Once the sugar has melted and the mixture is warm, take it off the double boiler.

4. Beat thoroughly with a hand mixer. Once the mixture turns whitish, make a figure eight, and if it takes a while for the liquid to settle, it's ready for you to tur the mixer to slow and even it out.

5. Mix in milk to the ingredients from Step 4, then add weak flour fun through a sieve. Mix with a rubber spatula, taking care not to crush any air bubbles that form.

6. Pour the ingredients from Step 5 into the baking sheet, and then level out the top. Cook in a 190°C degree oven for 11 minutes

7. Take out the lemon from Step 1, mash the apple, and add the chocolate bar and mix

8. Boil the Group B ingredients in a pot. Once the sugar melts, turn off the heat and when it's cooled add the rum.

9. Once the ingredients from Step 6 have finished cooking remove from the pan (along with the baking sheet) and give it a moment to cool down. Then put plastic wrap on it, and allow it to cool to room temperature.

10. Remove the dough from baking sheet. Cover the side that's browned with the ingredients from Step 8, then spread out the Step 7 ingredients on top of it. Roll up the dough, and let it sit for a while to set.

11. Put the ingredients from Group C into a bowl, then put that bowl in ice water and beat until peaks form.

12. Melt baking chocolate in a double boiler. Add some of the mixture from Step 11 and stir, then return to the bowl with the rest of the mixture and stir with the rest

13. Cut off part of the edge of Step 10 and then place it on top to make it look like a log

14. Cover the surface with the mixture from Step 12 and use a fork to draw a design. Strain some cocoa powder on it and add some edible silver beads, and you're done!
