                "Salt and pepper the chicken breasts. Cut the onions and carrots into thin slices. Clean the mushrooms and remove the bottom part of the stem",

                "Dissolve the bouillon cube in 600cc of hot water, then add in 1 tsp of lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Put the mushrooms in cap down. Once the water comes to a boil turn off the heat and let sit.",

                "Heat butter and vegetable oil in a frying pan, then put the chicken thighs in skin-side down. Cook both sides and remove.",

                "Put onions and carrots into the frying pan from Step 3, and then fry until soft",

### "points": [
                "Since it's a white stew, don't cook them too much. Even if they aren't fully cooked, they'll be stewed later so it's okay!"
